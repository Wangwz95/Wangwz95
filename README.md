- Hi, I am Wenzhi Wang, a Mphil student at the University of Oxford. My email is wenzhi.wang@lmh.ox.ac.uk.
- I am determined to delve deeper in empirical economics research, with special focus on China's labor market and unique public policies.
- I am not satisfied with just running regressions and would like to get more training in structural modeling methods because certain important policy debates cannot be easily evaluated through design-based methods. I am now working hard to lay a solid foundation on mathematical knowledge and programming skills.
- My past research papers include:
  - Breaking the "Iron Rice Bowl": Employment Insecurity and Intra-household Bargaining
  - Fertility Restrictions and Old-age Labor Supply: Evidence from China's "LLF" Campaign
  - The Causal Effects of Maternal Education on her Children's Cognitive Abilities (in Chinese)
- My recent working papers are:
  -  More Political Allegiance? The Spillover Effects of China's Poverty Alleviation Program
  -  To Curb Digital Addiction: Evidence from Age Restrictions in Playing Online Games
  -  The Macro Consequences of "Children Pension" in an Imperfect Public Pension System: Evidence from China
