- Hi, I am Wenzhi (Eric) Wang, an undergraduate student in Guanghua School of Management, Peking University. My email is ericwang_econ@pku.edu.cn.
- I am determined to delve deeper in empirical economics research, with special focus on the China's labor markets and unique public policies.
- I believe that the combination between the design-based (reduced-form) and model-based (structural) research will become the mainstream in the future. Therefore, I am not satisfied to just become a "reg monkey", and I am now working really hard to lay a solid foundation on analysis, probability and statistics. 
- My past research papers include:
  - Breaking the "Iron Rice Bowl": Employment Insecurity and Intra-household Bargaining.
  - Fertility Restrictions and Old-age Labor Supply: Evidence from China's ``LLF'' Campaign.
  - The Causal Effects of a Mother's Education on her Children's Cognitive Abilities.
- My recent working papers are:
  -  More political allegiant? The spillover effects of China's poverty alleviation campaign.
  -  Can governments do better than parents in combatting children's digital addicition? Evidence from China.
