- Hi, I’m Wenzhi (Eric) Wang, an undergraduate student in Guanghua School of Management, Peking University.
- My email is ericwang_econ@pku.edu.cn.
- I’m determined to delve deeper in economics research. And my fields of interest include labor and public economics.
- I’m not satisfied to just become a "reg monkey", and believe that the combination between the design-based (reduced-form) and model-based (structural) research will eventually become the mainstream.
- My past research papers include:
-- Breaking the "Iron Rice Bowl": Employment Insecurity and Intra-household Bargaining
-- Fertility Restrictions and Old-age Labor Supply: Evidence from China's ``LLF'' Campaign
-- The Causal Effects of a Mother's Education on her Children's Cognitive Abilities
